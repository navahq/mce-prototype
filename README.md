# Local development

This prototype uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) to generate a progressive, static HTML site from React, Sass, and JSON data files.

## Installation

The instructions below reference NPM, but you can also use Yarn if you prefer.

npm install
```

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible at `localhost:8000`, and a GraphQL IDE at `localhost:8000/___graphql`

### `npm run build`

Gatsby will perform an optimized production build for your site generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles.

### `npm run serve`

Gatsby starts a local HTML server for testing your built site.

### `npm run lint`
